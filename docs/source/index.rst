   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to orsaytrace's documentation!
======================================

Last version of OrsayTrace can be downloaded alway in our
`Github <https://github.com/yvesauad/OrsayTrace>`_ repository. You will have
access to everything, including the `Examples <examples.html>`_ updated source
code.

Alternatively, stable versions of main module can be downloaded using
`PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/pip/>`_ in our
`orsaytrace <https://pypi.org/project/orsaytrace/>`_ link.

orsaytrace is a side project performed during my phd thesis in nano-optics.
Thesis is funded by
`Universit√© Paris Saclay <https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/>`_ and work
was done in `Laboratoire de Physique des Solides <https://www.lps.u-psud.fr/>`_ @ STEM group.
